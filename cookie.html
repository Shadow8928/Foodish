    <img src="chocolate-chip-cookies.jpg" alt="Chocolate Chip Cookies">
    <p>Ingredients:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
        <li>2 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</li>   
        <li>3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>


        </ul>
    <p>Instructions:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven: Set your oven to 375°F (190°C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Cream wet ingredients: In a large bowl, cream together the butter, granulated sugar, and brown sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla extract.</li>   
                <li>Combine dry ingredients: In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and salt.</li>
                    <li>Mix wet and dry ingredients: Gradually add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing until just combined. Be careful not to overmix.</li>   
                        <li>Add chocolate chips: Stir in the chocolate chips until evenly distributed.</li>
                            <li>Scoop and bake: Scoop the dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving space between each cookie. Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until golden brown.</li>
                                <li>Cool and enjoy: Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
        </ol>
    <p>Tips:</p>
      <Li>Don't overmix: Overmixing can lead to tough cookies.</Li>
          <Li>Chill the dough: Chilling the dough for at least 30 minutes will help the cookies hold their shape and prevent them from spreading too much.</Li>
              <Li>Use high-quality chocolate chips: Good quality chocolate chips will make a big difference in the flavor of your cookies.</Li>
                  <Li>Experiment with flavors: Add nuts, spices, or other mix-ins to your cookies for different flavors.</Li>
